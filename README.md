# Full Stack Volunteer management website for BigAtHeart

**Goal of the project:** 
Produce a web based application which acts as a device to educate and inform all visitors about who BigAtHeart is, what they do and the current ongoing projects that they can join.
We want it to inspire and increase the retention of volunteers they currently have or will have as well.
Easily accessible for volunteers to sign up and manageable by admins.
